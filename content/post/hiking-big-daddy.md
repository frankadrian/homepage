Sossusvlei has become one of Namibias main tourist attractions. It is located in the South Western part of the Country and the closest “town” is Sesrim. I say “town” because this literally only consists of a petrol (gas) station.
Sossusvlei is located in the Namib Desert, the oldest and driest desert in the world. It is located at the end of a river which is called the Tsauchab. The Tsauchab river flows from the Naukluft mountains and ends where the dunes start to become bigger and bigger. Here for many years water collected and formed the clay pan we now know as Soussusvlei and Deadvlei.

## To get there:


To get to the Vlei it takes about a 60 minute drive from the closest town, Sesriem. Since it is located in a National Park you can only enter with sun rise, and you have to exit by sun set. With a few exceptions, the NWR Desert Dune Lodge and the camping site by the national park gate. From anywhere else you have to wait till the gate opens to enter. If you are coming to this part of the Country I highly recommend you to use one of the Accommodation options which are inside the National Park. This allows you to leave into the Vlei whenever you want and it is possible to be hiking up the biggest Dune, behind Deadvlei by Sunrise. This is the best way to experience this incredible part of Namibia. Also you will be able to take stunning photos with sunrise in order to truly enjoy and appreciate this beautiful part of the country.

## What to except:

Most people first visit Dune 45, which is on the way to Sosusvlei, and from here they continue to Dune 47, which apparently is the highest Dune in the World. Dune 47 is also called Big Daddy because of its size.
I always recommend that you first go to Big daddy and if time allows you can go back to Dune 45 again later the day or the next day if you iternary allows for it.
By this Dune there are 2 Vleis, Sossusvlei and Deadvlei.
Most people actually want to visit Deadvlei, as this is known for the dead trees in the white pan, surrounded by red dunes.

Hiking up first to Big Daddy can be challenging as there are no steps you can walk in.

Hike up “Big Daddy”


## Before the hike
Once you are inside the Namib Naukluft Park there are 2 parking spots, one for non-4x4 vehicles and the final parking from where you start the hike. To reach the final parking you will need a 4x4 vehicle, otherwise you can pay for a shuttle to drive you the last few kilometres. If you drive by yourself make sure to deflate you tires in order not to get stuck ;) A good tire pressure is about 1.5 to 1.7 Bar.
It is also possible to hike the 4x4 section, which is about 3 or 4 kilometres, if your fitness allows it. If possible try not to walk here in the middle of the day, the heat, especially during the lunch hours, can become quite exhausting and dangerous to hike.

Hiking up Big daddy can exhausting so it is absolutely necessary to pack some snacks as well as enough Water. For an average fit person the hike can take about 1 hour to reach the top.

## Start the hike

The best times to hike up Big Daddy is very early in the morning, ideally you start just before sunrise, or you go in the late afternoon to enjoy the sundowner.
Starting before sunrise can become tricky because the Gate to the National Park (60km before the parking) only opens with sunrise (see above).

From the 4x4 Parking spot head South to go in parallel to the Deadvlei. It will not be visible yet as it is hidden behind  the row of dunes on your right.
The first dune can be skipped by walking past it towards the south and starting the climb from the next saddle heading up top big daddy. The saddle where you start going up the dune is about 1000 meters from the 4x4 Parking spot. Depending on how early you arrive you might see foot steps or people hiking up the dune already. If you are the first to start the hike see this map as a guide to where to walk.

## Hiking up Big Daddy

Hiking up a dune can be a challenge by itself, as it feels like for every step you take you fall back about half a step again.
Also, it is easier to make small steps but more of them instead of making huge steps. If there are foot steps on the dune already the best advice is to step in the previous persons foot steps. This makes the hike sufficiently easier and you won’t slide down as much as if you are the first one to hike up.
It is recommended to take regular breaks and save some energy as the hike tends to be longer than one expects.

If you start late in the day take some socks you can put over your feet to not have to burn your foot soles. Shoes are not necessary but if you feel uncomfortable to walk the first part through the pan barefoot take some sandals that you can put into your backpack once you reach the dune.
