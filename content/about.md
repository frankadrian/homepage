Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Frank Adrian and I am a software developer with over 10 years of experience in the field. I started my career as a junior software developer in 2013 and have since been working to constantly improve and expand my skills.

In 2016, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer and have been working as a self-employed contractor ever since.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in a variety of technologies and programming languages, including PHP, React, Angular, and Node.js. I have expertise in both front-end and back-end development, and enjoy working on full-stack projects that utilize these technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling and maintaining our Schrebergarten (a small plot of land used for gardening, often found in urban areas in Germany). I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry.

My current goal with this website is to start writing again and also have people find the content that I write about.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you find the information and resources here helpful. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about me and my work, please don't hesitate to reach out via any channel provided here ðŸ‘‹.
